title: Hard vs Soft Clipping
---
In this post, we explore the difference between hard and soft clipping overdrive circuits.

# Hard clipping (or shunt-clipping)

Hard clipping is found in a variety of popular over-drive pedals, including the ProCo Rat, MXR Distortion+, 
Boss DS-1&2, and the Klon Centaur.
A hard clipping circuit introduces a double-diode shunt to ground after the op-amp gain stage,
as follows:

Imagine the (amplified) input signal is $V_I$, and we probe the voltage $V_O$. In particular,
we assume that the impedance at the output probe is much much higher than
the resistance through any other part of the circuit.

Following [Shockley's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley_diode_equation),
the current through the double-diode shunt is

$$I_{\operatorname{shunt}}(V_O)=I_S\big(e^{\frac{V_O}{K}}-e^{\frac{-V_O}{K}}\big),$$

Where $I_S$ is the reverse bias saturation current, $K=nV_T$, where $V_T$ 
is the thermal voltage, and $n$ is the ideality factor of the diode.
This must match the current through the resistor, so

$$\frac{V_I-V_O}{R_1} = I_S\big(e^\frac{V_O}{K}-e^\frac{-V_O}{K}\big)$$

Thus, we get

$$V_I = R_1I_S\big(e^\frac{V_O}{K}-e^\frac{-V_O}{K}\big)+V_O.$$

Letting 

$$f(V_O) = f_{R_1,I_S,K}(V_O):=R_1I_S\big(e^\frac{V_O}{K}-e^\frac{-V_O}{K}\big)+V_O,$$

we see that 

$$V_O = f^{-1}(V_I).$$

When $R_1$ represents a 1k transistor, and for silicon diodes, $V_O$ 
depends on $V_I$ as:

For large values of $V_I$, we have approximately $V_O\cong K\log(V_I),$
which flattens out very quickly (i.e. clips hard).

Passing a sine-wave (at different gain levels) through this shunt-clipping circuit results in
the following clipped signal:

# Soft clipping (or feedback-clipping)

Soft clipping is a second common clipping method for overdrive pedals, and
is used in the Tube-Screamer, the Boss OD-1, and the Timmy, to name a few. 
It introduces a double-diode shunt in the feedback loop of the gain stage:

We make a few simplifying assumptions: 
- The op amp operates in linear (i.e., not saturated) mode, so the 
difference in voltage between the non-inverting (+) pin and the 
inverting (âˆ’) pin is negligibly small. In particular, the voltage 
at the (-) pin is approximately $V_I$.
- The input impedance through the non-inverting pin is much larger
than any other resistance in the circuit.

Then the current through $R_2$ to the ground must be $V_I/R_2$, and this must
match the combined current through both the diodes and $R_1$. That is,

$$\frac{V_I}{R_2} =I_S\big(e^{\frac{V_O-V_I}{K}}-e^{\frac{V_I-V_O}{K}}\big) + \frac{V_O-V_I}{R_1},$$

where we model the diodes via [Shockley's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley_diode_equation).
Rearranging terms, we get:

$$V_I\frac{R_1}{R_2} =R_1I_S\big(e^{\frac{V_O-V_I}{K}}-e^{\frac{V_I-V_O}{K}}\big) + (V_O-V_I),$$

That is, 

$$V_I\frac{R_1}{R_2} = f_{R_1,I_S,K}(V_O-V_I).$$

Solving for $V_O$, we get

$$V_O = f_{R_1,I_S,K}^{-1}\big(V_I\frac{R_1}{R_2}\big)+V_I.$$

In the special case that $R_1=R_2$, this matches the hard-clipping
function, except for the addition of the extra $V_I$ summand, which 
softens the clipping:

$$V_O = \overset{\text{hard-clipping term}}{\overbrace{f^{-1}(V_I)}}+\overset{\text{softening term}}{\overbrace{V_I}}.$$

However, the gain when $R_1=R_2$ just doubles the input voltage, and very little clipping
occurs. 
However, choosing $R_1=5$ and  $R_2=.1$ with silicon diodes, $V_O$ 
depends on $V_I$ as:

Note that this curve still grows steadily for all values of $V_I$. More precisely, for very large 
values of $V_I$, we have $V_O\cong V_I$. 
To summarize, signals are amplified on the order of $1+\frac{R1}{R2}$ until they reach a certain "clipping"
threshold at which point they grow slowly but linearly - rather than fully flattening out.

Passing a sine-wave (at different gain levels) through this shunt-clipping circuit results in
the following clipped signal:

These signals are clipped far more softly, remaining more sinusoidal
than the hard clipped ones.
