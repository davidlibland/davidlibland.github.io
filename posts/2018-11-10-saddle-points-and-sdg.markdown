title: Saddle Points and Stochastic Gradient Descent
---
Essentially all machine learning models are trained using gradient descent. 
However, neural networks introduce two new challenges for gradient descent to 
cope with: saddle points and massive training sets. In this post we describe 
how these two challenges conspire together to create deadly traps, and we 
discuss means to escape them.

## Background: Optimizing a loss function:
Machine learning algorithms attempt to model observed data in order to predict 
properties about unobserved data, and in most cases they do this by:

1. Parametrizing a space of models (with some parameters 
$\vec{\bf{x}} = (x_1,\dots, x_m)$),
2. Defining a loss function $f(\vec{\bf{x}})\to \mathbb{R}$ which measures the 
total error between the model at parameters $\vec{\bf{x}} = (x_1,\dots, x_m)$ 
and the observed data,
3. Finding the optimal parameters $\vec{\bf{x}} = (x_1,\dots, x_m)$  which 
minimize the loss.

Assuming we've completed steps (1) and (2), the question then becomes: How do 
we minimize a high dimensional function $f(\vec{\bf{x}})\to \mathbb{R}$?

<!--![Loss Function](../images/saddle-points-and-sdg/loss_function.png)-->

## We use gradient descent:
Although there are many possible ways to minimize a function, by and far the 
most successful approach for machine learning is to use gradient descent. This 
is a greedy algorithm, where we make an initial first guess $\vec{\bf{x}}_0$ 
for the optimal parameters, and then iteratively modifying that guess by moving 
in the direction in which $f$ decreases most quickly, that is:

$$\vec{\bf{x}}_n = \vec{\bf{x}}_{n-1} - \nabla f$$

(where $\nabla f$ denotes the gradient of $f$). With some basic assumptions, 
the sequence of guesses $\vec{\bf{x}}_0, \vec{\bf{x}}_1, \vec{\bf{x}}_2, \vec{\bf{x}}_3, \dots$ 
can be shown to improve steadily, and if $f$ is sufficiently nice (for example 
if $f$ is strongly convex), then this sequence will converge to a (local) 
minimum of $f$ fairly quickly.

![Gradient Descent, pictured here by a red path starting from a poor initial choice for $\vec{\bf{x}}$ (where $f(\vec{\bf{x}})$ is large) converges fairly quickly to a local minimum.](../images/saddle-points-and-sdg/gradient_descent1.png)

## Saddle points
We now introduce the first villain in our saga, saddle points, which are 
known to cause problems for gradient descent. A saddle point is a critical 
point[^critical_point] of a function which is neither a local minima or maxima.

[^critical_point]: That is $\vec{\bf{x}}$ is a critical point if $\nabla f=0$
 at $\vec{\bf{x}}$. Said differently $f$ is flat to first order near $\vec{\bf{x}}$.

![The red and green curves intersect at a generic saddle point in two dimensions. Along the green curve the saddle point looks like a local minimum, while it looks like a local maximum along the red curve.](../images/saddle-points-and-sdg/saddle_point.png)

Locally, up to a rotation and translation, any function $f$ is well 
approximated near a saddle point by

$$\overset{concave}
{\overbrace{\frac{-a_1}{2}x_1^2+\dots +\frac{-a_k}{2}x_k^2}}
+ \overset{convex}{\overbrace{\frac{a_{k+1}}{2}x_{k+1}^2+\dots+\frac{a_m}{2}x_m^2}}$$

where $1<k<m$ and all $a_i>0$, and the translation sends the saddle point to 
the origin.

#### Gradient descent proceeds extremely slowly near a saddle point. 
Why? Well, $\nabla f=0$ at a saddle point $\vec{\bf{x}}$ so the 
gradient $\nabla f\simeq 0$ will be extremely small near the saddle point. 
Recall that each gradient descent update is given by 
$\vec{\bf{x}}_n = \vec{\bf{x}}_{n-1}- \nabla f$. So 
$\vec{\bf{x}}_n \simeq \vec{\bf{x}}_{n-1}$, and each update barely improves 
the current guess. You can see this quite clearly in the following picture:

![Gradient descent proceeds slowly near a saddle point, so the points $\vec{\bf{x}}_n$ cluster more closely around the saddle points.](../images/saddle-points-and-sdg/gradient_descent2.png)

Nevertheless, if we choose $\vec{\bf{x}}_0$ randomly, then almost certainly:

#### Gradient descent will (eventually) escape saddle points  

Recall the gradient descent formula
$$\vec{\bf{x}}_n = \vec{\bf{x}}_{n-1} +\Delta \vec{\bf{x}}_{n-1}, \quad \text{ where } \quad \Delta \vec{\bf{x}}= - \nabla f$$
in coordinates, this reads:
$$\Delta x_i = - \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}$$

Meanwhile the local model for a saddle point at the origin is:
$$f(x_1,\dots,x_n) = \overset{concave}
{\overbrace{\frac{-a_1}{2}x_1^2+\dots +\frac{-a_k}{2}x_k^2}}
+ \overset{convex}{\overbrace{\frac{a_{k+1}}{2}x_{k+1}^2+\dots+\frac{a_m}{2}x_m^2}}$$

Now, we have 
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} = -a_ix_i\quad \text{ for } i<=k\quad\quad
\text{ and }\quad\quad\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} = a_ix_i\quad \text{ for } i>k$$

So:
    $$\Delta x_i = a_ix_i \quad \text{ for } i<=k \quad \text{ (repulsive dynamics)}$$
and
$$\Delta x_i = -a_ix_i \quad \text{ for } i>k \quad \text{ (attractive dynamics)}$$

Though we are attracted to the saddle point in some directions, we are 
eventually ejected from the saddle point by the repulsive forces. Indeed
it can be shown that with random initialization, we will almost surely 
escape[^Lee_et_al]

[^Lee_et_al]: Lee JD, Simchowitz M, Jordan MI, Recht B. Gradient Descent Converges to Minimizers. 2016;(Equation 1):1â€“11. 

Finally, we should emphasize that there are **lots** of saddle points in deep 
neural networks.

## Typically, the loss function in deep neural networks is noisy
For most machine learning algorithms, the loss function can be written as a 
sum over the training data:

$$ f(\vec{\bf{x}}) = \sum_j^N f_j(\vec{\bf{x}}),$$

where $N$ is the number of training samples, and each $f_i(\vec{\bf{x}})$ 
measures the model's error on the $i$-th training  sample. 
<!--This allows us to compute the gradient $\nabla f$ as a sum of terms:
$$ \nabla f(\vec{\bf{x}}) = \sum_j^N \nabla f_j(\vec{\bf{x}}).$$
-->
Now, deep neural networks need massive data sets to train successfully, and so 
it is extremely costly to evaluate the loss over the entire training set. 
Instead, 
one typically approximates the loss on a randomly chosen minibatch 
$J\subset \{1,\dots, N\}$ of data, 
$$ f_{J-approx}(\vec{\bf{x}}) = \sum_{j\in J} f_j(\vec{\bf{x}}).$$
This subsampling from the training data results in a _noisy_ loss function.

In turn, we modify the gradient descent algorithm as follows: on iteration, we 
choose a random minibatch $J\subset \{1,\dots, N\}$ and update our previous 
guess by:
$$\vec{\bf{x}}_n = \vec{\bf{x}}_{n-1} +\Delta \vec{\bf{x}}_{n-1}, \quad \text{ where } \quad \Delta \vec{\bf{x}}= - \nabla f_{J-approx}$$
It is worthwhile noting that minibatches chosen randomly at each iteration are 
mutually independent. The resulting algorithm is known as 
**stochastic gradient descent**.

Adding this noise, however, can have some surprising consequences near saddle 
points:

## Example:
Consider the following function, standard gradient descent does an excellent 
job of finding the minimum:

![](../images/saddle-points-and-sdg/sdg_0noise.png)

Now, we will add some noise[^medium_noise]. Notice that it doesn't roll 
immediately into the basin, but lingers along the ridge somewhat.

[^medium_noise]: By gently shaking the surface: that is, we translate it by a
 normally distributed random variable with standard deviation 1.

![](../images/saddle-points-and-sdg/sdg_1noise.png)

Adding more noise[^strong_noise] causes it to converge fairly rapidly to the 
saddle point between the two minima.

[^strong_noise]: By shaking the surface: that is, we translate it by a 
normally distributed random variable with standard deviation 2.

![](../images/saddle-points-and-sdg/sdg_2noise.png)

What is going on here? How can noise cause gradient descent to become trapped 
at saddle points?


<!--## Overview of talk:
- I will describe why noise can trap us at saddle points
- I will describe some ways to escape saddle points
- Open questions-->

## Why noise hurts
To simplify our discussion, we will restrict ourselves to one of the concave 
down principal axes of the saddle point - along which the dynamics ought to be 
repulsive -  in which case the local model becomes one dimensional:
$$f(x)= -ax^2.$$
with $a$ positive. The 
corresponding local model for the noisy loss function is:
$$f(x)=-(a+\xi)x^2 - \eta x$$
where $\xi$ and $\eta$ are mean zero random variables encoding the noisy 
measurement of the coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$ in the Taylor expansion 
(note that $f$ is now a random variable as well).

<!-- The local model for a saddle point in a noisy loss function is:
$$f(x_1,\dots,x_n) = \overset{concave}
{\overbrace{\frac{-a_1-\xi_1}{2}x_1^2+\dots +\frac{-a_k-\xi_k}{2}x_k^2}}
+ \overset{convex}{\overbrace{\frac{a_{k+1}-\xi_{k+1}}{2}x_{k+1}^2+\dots+\frac{a_m-\xi_m}{2}x_m^2}}\\
-\eta_1x_1-\cdots-\eta_mx_m
$$
where $\xi_i$ and $\eta_i$ are mean zero random variables encoding the noisy 
measurement of each coefficient. -->

So, we have 
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = -ax -\xi x-\eta$$
And the gradient descent update becomes:
$$\Delta x =a x+ \xi x+\eta$$

Let's consider the separate components
    $$ \Delta x =
    \overset{\text{Usual gradient}}{\overbrace{ax}} 
    +\overset{\text{Attractive noise}}{\overbrace{\xi x}}+\overset{\text{Diffusive noise}}{\overbrace{\eta}}$$

## Attractive noise:
Let's start by considering the attractive noise in isolation, ie. 
$\Delta x = \xi x$. The corresponding update is
$$x_{n+1}=x_n + \xi x_n = (1+\xi) x_{n}$$

Suppose that we flip a coin at each iteration and $\xi$ equals $\sigma$ if we
 get heads or 
$-\sigma$ if we roll tails. Then after 1 iteration, $x$
 is 
rescaled by either a factor of $1-\sigma$ or $1+\sigma$ (with equal 
probability). We picture the possible transitions below:

![](../images/saddle-points-and-sdg/stage_1_scr.jpeg)

Next, consider what the possiblilities are after two iterations: $x$ is rescaled
 by a factor of either
 
1. $(1-\sigma)^2$ if we roll two tails (with probably 
$\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{2}\times 
\frac{1}{2}$)
2. $(1-\sigma^2)=(1-\sigma)(1+\sigma)$ in two distinct ways: we roll either a 
heads and then a tails or vice versa (with total probability $\frac{1}{2} = 
2\times(\frac{1}{2}\times \frac{1}{2})$)
3. $(1+\sigma)^2$ if we roll two tails (with probably 
  $\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{2}\times 
  \frac{1}{2}$)

Since the first two scaling factors are both less than one, $\lvert 
x_2\rvert<\lvert x_0\rvert$ with probability $\frac{3}{4}$.

[^average_scale]: On the other hand, the average value of the scaling factors
 is 1. Indeed the expected value of $x_n$ is $x_0$ for all $n$.

![The possible 2-step transitions. The red numbers indicate the relative frequency of the corresponding state.](../images/saddle-points-and-sdg/stage_2_scr.jpeg)

Continuing like this we see that $\lvert x_4\rvert<\lvert x_0\rvert$ with 
probability at least $\frac{11}{16}$.

![The possible 4-step transitions.  The red numbers indicate the relative frequency of the corresponding state.](../images/saddle-points-and-sdg/stage_4_scr.jpeg)

Indeed we see that the mode of $x_n$ - for which we expect an equal number of 
heads and tails, namely $n/2$ - is 
$$(1-\sigma)^{n/2}(1+\sigma)^{n/2}x_0=(1-\sigma^2)^{n/2}x_0,$$
and $x_n$ gravitates towards zero[^average_scale] at an average rate of 
$$\frac{1}{n}(-\sigma^2\frac{n}{2})=-\frac{\sigma^2}{2}.$$

In fact, we have $\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n = 0$ with probability 1. The figure
below illustrates this trend for larger and larger $n$.

![With $\sigma=0.1$, we sample $x_n$ (at $n=10, 20, 100, 1000$); those $x_n$ 
with $\lvert x_n\rvert \leq\lvert x_0\rvert$ are colored red, while the rest 
are colored blue.](../images/saddle-points-and-sdg/stage_n.png)


# Diffusive noise:
Recall:
    $$ \Delta x =
    \overset{\text{Usual gradient}}{\overbrace{ax}} 
    +\overset{\text{Attractive noise}}{\overbrace{\xi x}}+
    \overset{\text{Diffusive noise}}{\overbrace{\eta}}$$
    
So the diffusive component is:
    $$ \Delta x = \eta$$
    
If we isolate the diffusive compenent, then after $N$ iterations we have
$$x_N=x_0+\sum_{n=0}^N \Delta x_n = x_0+\sum_{i=0}^N \eta_i$$

Here $\eta_i$ are iid random variables with mean zero. If we assume the 
standard deviation of $\eta_i$ is $\tau$
 then by the central limit theorem, $\sum_{i=0}^N \eta_i\sim N(0, 
 \tau\sqrt{N})$. 
 Therefore:

$$x_N\sim N(x_0, \tau\sqrt{N})$$

In summary, $x$ diffuses at a rate of $\tau\sqrt{N}$.

## Does the diffusive or attractive noise dominate?
Consider again the model for stochastic gradient descent localized around a 
saddle point:

$$ \Delta x =
    \overset{\text{Usual gradient}}{\overbrace{ax}} 
    +\overset{\text{Attractive noise}}{\overbrace{\xi x}}
    +\overset{\text{Diffusive noise}}{\overbrace{\eta}}$$
    
Since the intensity of the attractive noise is proportional to $x$, it's clear
that the attractive noise dominates the behavior for sufficiently large values
 of $x$, while the diffusive noise dominates the behavior for sufficiently 
 small values of $x$.

This describes the behavior at the two extremes. However, further direct 
analysis of the behavior is hampered by our not knowing anything about the 
random variables $\xi$ or $\eta$. Fortunately, if we assume they have finite
 moments, rescaled sums of independent draws of $\xi$ and $\eta$ limit to 
 Brownian motion, and it makes sense to replace the finite difference 
equation above with the corresponding stochastic differential equation

$$dx = ax \:dt+\xi x \:dt +\eta\: dt$$
where $\xi$ and $\eta$ are white noise whose correlation is time-independent.

Let $\sigma$ and $\tau$ represent the scaling factors such that 
$W_t=\int_0^t\frac{\xi}{\sigma}\:dt$ and $V_t=\int_0^t\frac{\eta}{\tau}\:dt$ are 
standard Brownian motion, and let $\rho$ denote their correlation.[^brownian] 
Then we may write the equation as

[^brownian]: So for any times $t$ and $s$, the variances are $\mathbb{E}
\big((W_t-W_s)^2\big)=(t-s)$, 
and $\mathbb{E}\big((U_t-U_s)^2\big)=(t-s)$, while the correlation is 
$\mathbb{E}\big((W_t-W_s)(U_t-U_s)\big) = \rho(t-s)$.

$$dx = ax \:dt+\sigma x \:dW +\tau\: dU$$

Substituting 
\begin{align}
\mu &= \frac{\tau\rho}{\sigma}, &
\omega &= \tau\sqrt{1-\rho^2}, \text{ and }\\
V &= \frac{U-\rho W}{\sqrt{1-\rho^2}} & y&=x+\mu
\end{align}
yields the stochastic differential equation
$$dy  = a(y-\mu)\:dt +\sigma y\:dW+\omega\: dV$$
where $V$ and $W$ are independent standard Brownian motions.

This equation has the following analytical solution:

$$y_t = y_0e^{(a-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})t+\sigma W_t}+\int_0^t e^{
(a-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})(t-s)+\sigma (W_t-W_s)}d\nu$$
where $\nu = \omega V_s-a\mu s$, as can be verified directly by differentiation
(using [Ito's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%C3%B4%27s_lemma)).

In particular, we see that the attractive noise shifts the rate of 
exponential growth from $a$ to $a-\frac{\sigma^2}{2}$
.[^same_rate] Thus, if $a< \frac{\sigma^2}{2}$, then the growth rate becomes 
negative, namely the saddle point becomes attractive. Indeed, if 
there is no diffusive noise (i.e. $\tau=0$), the solution reduces to 
$x_t = x_0e^{(a-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})t+\sigma W_t}$, which almost surely converges
 to zero.
 
[^same_rate]: Note that $-\frac{\sigma^2}{2}$ is the same convergence rate that 
appeared in the discrete case.

## Stationary distribution:

We would like to undestand the long term behaviour of $x_t$. 
If $a< \frac{\sigma^2}{2}$, then $x_\infty:=\lim_{t\to\infty}x_t$ converges 
to a stationary distribution[^dufresne]. We solve for the 
stationary 
distribution in the [appendix](#Appendix_A) and find that the random variable
$x_\infty:=\lim_{t\to\infty}x_t$ is 
[Pearson distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_distribution). 
In particular, when $\omega \neq 0$, $x_\infty$ is governed by 
the following probability density: 

$$p(y_\infty)=\frac{1}{Z}\left(\sigma^{2}y_\infty^{2}  + \omega^{2}\right)
^{\frac{a}{\sigma^{2}} - 1} 
e^{- \frac{2 a \mu \operatorname{atan}{\left (\frac{ \sigma\, y_\infty}{\omega}
 \right )}}
{\omega \sigma}}, \text{ where } x_\infty = y_\infty-\mu.$$
Here $Z$ is a normalizing constant (we will discuss the case where 
$\omega=0$ in the next subsection).

Note that the random variable $x_\infty$ is 
non integrable, which is to say its expected value is infinite. However, we do
not expect $x_t$ to diverge: for instance, for large $R$, the odds that 
$\lvert \lim_{t\to\infty}x_t \rvert > R$ become negligibly small: 
$$\mathbb{P}(\lvert \lim_{t\to\infty}x_t \rvert > R) = 
O\big(\big(\frac{1}{R}\big)^{1-\frac{2a}{\sigma^{2}}}\big)\text{ as } R\to 
\infty$$

risk theory and pension funding. Vol. 1990, Scandinavian Actuarial 
Journal. 1990. p. 39â€“79.

Indeed, the mode of this distribution is at $y = a\mu/(a-\sigma^2)$, which
translates to $x=\frac{\rho \sigma \tau}{a - \sigma^{2}}$.

### Special Case 1: $\xi$ and $\eta$ are perfectly correlated
The special case where $\omega=0$ corresponds to $\xi$ and $\eta$ being 
perfectly correlated. In this case $y_\infty$ is 
[Inverse Gamma-distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-gamma_distribution)[^dufresne]. 
To describe the distribution of $x_\infty$, we may assume without loss of 
generality that $\rho=1$. Then
$x_\infty+\tau/\sigma$ is an
[Inverse Gamma-distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-gamma_distribution) 
random variable with scale $\beta = -2\frac{ a\tau}{\sigma^3}$ and 
shape $\alpha = 1-2a/\sigma^2$.

### Special Case 2: $\xi$ and $\eta$ are *not* correlated
In this case, $\rho=0$, and $x_\infty$
is [Student's t-distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution)
with $\nu =1-\frac{2a}{\sigma^2}$ degrees of freedom, location $\mu=0$, 
and scale $\sqrt{\frac{\tau^2}{\sigma^2-2a}}$.

$$\hat x_t=x_0e^{(a-\sigma^2/2)t+\sigma W_t}$$
of the equation 
$$d\hat x = a\hat x \:dt+\sigma \hat x \:dW$$
Explictly, we have
$$x_t = x_0e^{(a-\sigma^2/2)t+\sigma W_t} + \int_0^te^{(a-\sigma^2/2)(t-s)+\sigma (W_t-W_s)}\eta \: ds$$

## How should we escape saddle points in the presence of noise?
We can categorize some major strategies as follows:

- #### Decrease the attractive noise
    - [Increase the minibatch size](#DEC_ATT_NOISE)
    - [Decrease/Anneal the learning rate](#DEC_ATT_NOISE)
    - [Stochastic Variance Reduction Gradient Descent](#SVRG)
- #### Increase the diffusive noise
    - [Perturbed Stochastic Gradient Descent](#PSGD)
- #### Do not use a smooth loss function
    - [Use ReLu's](#USE_RELU)




## Basic means to escape saddle points: {#DEC_ATT_NOISE}

Some basic methods to decrease the attractive noise are to:

- ##### Increase the minibatch size.
    - Increasing the minibatch size by a factor of $\alpha$ decreases the 
    attractive noise by a factor of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha}}$ which in turn 
    decreases the odds of becoming stuck at the 
    saddle point.
     In more detail, recall that the saddle point ceases to be 
     attractive when $\frac{\sigma^2}{2} < a$. Increasing the minibatch by a 
     factor of $\alpha$ scales $\sigma$ to $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{\alpha}}$. 
     Thus for $\frac{\sigma^2}{2a} < \alpha$, we expect to escape the saddle 
     point. Unfortunately, the computational cost of each gradient step roughly 
     increases by a factor of $\alpha$ as well.
- ##### Decrease/Anneal the learning rate.
    - Scaling the gradient descent updates by a learning 
    rate of $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ scales both $a$ and $\sigma$ by 
    $\frac{1}{\alpha}$. In particular,
     the saddle point will cease to be attractive if $\frac{a}{\alpha}> 
     \frac{1}{2}\big(\frac{\sigma}{\alpha}\big)^2$. Thus, for learning 
     rates 
     $\frac{1}{\alpha}< \frac{2a}{\sigma^2}$, stochastic gradient descent 
     should escape the
     saddle point. Indeed we will almost surely escape saddle points and 
     succeed in converging to a local minima if we appropriately anneal the 
     learning rate[^pemantle]. The downside is that if the learning rate is 
     too small, training may take
     overly long (it roughly scales the training time by a factor of $\alpha$).

## Stochastic Variance Reduction Gradient Descent {#SVRG}
Stochastic Variance Reduction Gradient Descent (SVRG)[^SVRG_cit] 
reduce the variance of stochastic gradient descent by modifying the procedure
as follows: given a "landmark point" $\tilde x$ and the full 
gradient $\mathbb{E}(\nabla f(\tilde x))$ at that landmark, we make gradient
updates at the location $x$ using the following *variance-reduced* 
gradient: 
$$\nabla_{VR,\tilde x}\: f(x):= \nabla f(x) + 
\overset{SVRG-modification}{\overbrace{
\big(\mathbb{E}(\nabla f(\tilde x))-\nabla f(\tilde x)\big)}}.$$
Notice that this modified "variance-reduced" gradient has the same expected 
value as the original noisy gradient, since the modification (the second 
term) has an expected value of zero. However, the variance of $\nabla_{VR,
\tilde x}\: f(x)$ is much less than $\nabla f(x)$ when $x$ is near $\tilde x$,
as becomes clear by regrouping the terms as follows:
$$\nabla_{VR,\tilde x}\: f(x):= \overset{A}{\overbrace{
\big(\nabla f(x)-\nabla f(\tilde x)\big)}} + 
\overset{B}{\overbrace{\mathbb{E}(\nabla f(\tilde x))}}.$$
Term $B$ has zero variance, while term $A$ is the difference of two 
postively correlated random variables, so it has low variance. Indeed, when
$x = \tilde x$, the variance of $A$ is zero. 

Since we need the landmark point $\tilde x$ to be near $x$, we simply update it
periodically (for example at the start of every epoch).

Given that SVRG reduces the variance of the gradient, we should expect it to
escape saddle points. Let's analyze it from the perspective of the machinery
developed above. We have:
$$\begin{align}
\nabla f(x) &= -ax \:dt-\sigma x \:dW -\tau\: dU,\\
-\nabla f(\tilde x) &= a\tilde x \:dt+\sigma \tilde x \:dW +\tau\: dU,\text{ and}\\
\mathbb{E}\big(\nabla f(\tilde x)\big) &= -a\tilde x \:dt\quad\text{ since 
}\mathbb{E}(dW)=\mathbb{E}(dU)=0\\
\end{align}$$
so 
$$\nabla_{VR,\tilde x}\: f(x) = -ax \:dt-\sigma x \:dW + \sigma 
\tilde x \:dW,$$
and the stochastic differential equation $dx=-\nabla_{VR,\tilde x}\: f(x)$ 
becomes
$$dx = ax \:dt+\sigma x \:dW +\tau' \:dW,$$
where $\tau'=- \sigma \tilde x$. We recognize this SDE as the special case 
where the attractive and diffusive noise are perfectly correlated; so 
$x_\infty+\tau'/\sigma=x_\infty-\tilde x$
 is an [Inverse Gamma-distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-gamma_distribution) 
random variable with scale 
$\beta = -2\frac{ a\tau'}{\sigma^3} = 2\frac{ a\tilde x}{\sigma^2}$ 
and shape $\alpha = 1-2a/\sigma^2$. In particular, with probability 1, 
$$\lvert x_\infty\rvert >\lvert \tilde x\rvert,$$
so we expect to move further from the saddle point every time we update the
landmark point $\tilde x$. Moreover, since the scale $\beta$ of 
the inverse gamma-distribution is proportional to $\tilde x$, heuristically,
 we expect the to escape no slower than gometrically in the updates of the
 landmark point, at a rate proportional to 
 $\beta/\tilde x = 2\frac{a}{\sigma^2}$.

- Interestingly, SVRGD serves correlate the two noises $\xi$ and $\eta$ in the 
equation $$dx = ax \:dt+\xi x \:dt +\eta\: dt$$
- Infact, at the end of every inner loop $x-x_*$ exhibits an inverse gamma 
distribution with scale proportionate to the distance from $x_*$ to the saddle 
point: -->

<!-- ## SVGRD guarantees that you will escape the saddle point

Infact, you expect to escape geometrically (in the outer loop)

### Problems:
- Unfortuately, you may need to compute the full gradient (updating $x_*$) 
before each foolproof step away from the saddle point.
- This results in the same computational cost as gradient descent (which is 
considered too expensive for training deep neural networks). -->

## Perturbed Stochastic Gradient Descent {#PSGD}

Perturbed stochastic gradient descent[^psgd] effectively increases the 
intensity $\tau$ of the diffusive noise in the equation 
$$dx = ax \:dt+\sigma x \:dW +\tau\: dU$$ while keeping the 
intensity $\sigma$ of the attractive noise as well as the deterministic 
growth rate $a$ fixed. 
In particular, $x_\infty$ remains Pearson  distributed. 

Since the  scale of the distribution of $x_\infty$ depends linearly on $\tau$, 
 it follows that $x_\infty$ will disperse proportionately. Thus, if we rescale 
 $\tau$ by a factor of $\alpha$, then, intuitively, 
 $\mathbb{P}(\lvert \lim_{t\to\infty}x_t \rvert < R)$
 will scale on the order of $\frac{1}{\alpha}$. 
 
 In a practical setting, the loss function will only be well approximated by 
 the local saddle point model within a finite radius $R$ of the saddle point,
 so the odds of being trapped there will decrease roughly by a factor of 
 $\frac{1}{\alpha}$. Summarizing this heuristic analysis, Perturbed Stochastic
 Gradient Descent should be an effective means of escaping saddle points in the 
 setting of a noisy loss function.

## Use ReLu's {#USE_RELU}
Regularized linear units result in piecewise linear loss functions. In 
theory, this dramatically changes the dynamics and eliminates the attractive 
noise in the local update equation (though some diffusive noise may remain).
In practice, if the piecewise linear loss function is sufficiently fine and 
well approximated by a smooth loss, then the above analysis may still 
indicate that the noise may cause stochastic gradient descent to suffer near
saddle points. Of course, it would be worthwhile to investigate the situation
 further.

## Open questions
In this post we examined the impact of noise on stochastic gradient descent 
near saddle points by looking at the limiting $t\to\infty$ stationary 
distribution. However, the local model 
$$f(\vec{\bf{x}}) \simeq \frac{\pm a_1}{2}x_1^2+\dots +\frac{\pm a_m}{2}x_m^2$$
for the loss function near a saddle point is just that: a *local* model. In 
practice, there will be a radius $R$ outside of which the local model is no 
longer an accurate approximation of loss function. It would be worthwhile 
exploring when trajectories $x_t$ of the stochastic differential equation
$$dx = ax \:dt+\sigma x \:dW +\tau\: dU$$
first exceed $R$ in absolute value. For instance, the following plot gives an
example of such a trajectory; notice that while it spends much of its time 
near zero, it makes some occasional very large forays away from zero; any such
foray might be sufficient to escape the saddle point.

![A sample plot of $x_t$ when $a=0.5$, $\sigma = 1.2$, and $\tau=0$.](../images/saddle-points-and-sdg/gbm_freq_exc.png)

In future work we would also like to explore whether or not saddle points in 
typical neural networks have strong attractive noise, and how the size and depth
of such networks affects the intensity of that attractive noise. For 
instance, there need only be a single strongly repulsive direction from a saddle point in order to 
escape; perhaps increasing the dimensionality of a network also increases the 
odds that such a direction exist.

## Appendix A: Solving for the stationary distribution  {#Appendix_A}
The [Fokker-Planck equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker%E2%80%93Planck_equation)
equation says that the probability density $p(y, t)$ to 
the stochastic differential equation
$$dy  = a(y-\mu)\:dt +\sigma y\:dW+\omega\: dV$$
solves the PDE 
$${\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}p(y, t)=-{\frac 
{\partial }{\partial y}}\left[A (y)p(y,t)\right]+{\frac {\partial 
^{2}}{\partial y^{2}}}\left[D(y)p(y,t)\right],$$
where $A(y) = a(y-\mu)$ and $D(y)=\frac{1}{2}(\sigma^2 y^2+\omega^2)$. For a 
stationary distribution, the time derivative on the left-hand-side vanishes. 
Thus, we have $\frac {\partial }{\partial y}J(y) = 0$, where $$J(y)=-A(y)p(y)
+\frac{\partial}{\partial y} [D(y)p(y)].$$
Since $J$ is constant and both $p$ and $\frac {\partial p}{\partial t}$ 
vanish at $\infty$, we must have $J(y)=0$, which yields the ODE:
 $$\frac{\partial}{\partial y} [D(y)p(y)]=A(y)p(y).$$
This, in turn, can be solved by standard techniques to find the solution
 $$\left(y^{2} \sigma^{2} + \omega^{2}\right)
 ^{\frac{a}{\sigma^{2}} - 1} 
 e^{- \frac{2 a \mu \operatorname{atan}{\left (\frac{y \sigma}{\omega} \right )}}
 {\omega \sigma}},$$
 up to a constant multiple.
 From the ODE, we also see
that 
$$A(y)-\frac{\partial D(y)}{\partial y} =0
\quad\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad\quad
\frac{\partial p(y)}{\partial y}=0,$$ 
which leads to the linear equation $0= y(a- \sigma^{2}) - a\mu$ for the mode of 
$p$.
